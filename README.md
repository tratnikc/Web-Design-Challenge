 ### Requirements
Create a visualization dashboard website consisting of 7 pages total, including:
* A landing page containing:
  * An explanation of the project
  * Links to each visualizations page.
* Four visualization pages, each with:
  * A descriptive title and heading tag
  * The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
  * A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.
* A Comparisons page that:
  * Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily visually compare them.
  * Uses a Bootstrap grid for the visualizations
* A Data page that:
  * Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.  
The website must, at the top of every page, have a navigation menu that:
 * Has the name of the site on the left of the nav which allows users to return to the landing page from any page.
 * Contains a dropdown menu on the right of the navbar named "Plots" that provides a link to each individual visualization page.
 * Provides two more text links on the right: "Comparisons", which links to the comparisons page, and "Data", which links to the data page.
 * Is responsive (using media queries).
